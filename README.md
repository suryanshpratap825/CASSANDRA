# CASSANDRA ‘by Suryansh’

### In today's tech world, Big Data is a common topic. It refers to very large datasets that are hard to handle and analyze using regular database tools.

### We often start with SQL databases for software development because they offer strong data consistency and reliability through ACID properties. However, as datasets grow rapidly, managing and processing this data becomes increasingly challenging. This is where NoSQL databases, like MongoDB and Cassandra, become essential. Cassandra is a popular NoSQL database designed to handle extremely large datasets efficiently.

### Examples of large datasets include telecommunication data and data from IoT devices.
